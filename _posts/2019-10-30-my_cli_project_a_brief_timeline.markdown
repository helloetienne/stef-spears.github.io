Here is a high-level overview of my process:

# Day 1

0. officially switch from the Learn IDE to a local environment, which entailed me downloading VSCode and leaving Atom in the dust for now
1. open up Mac Notes to clarify a purpose for my project to make sure I wasn't biting off more than I can chew, because I tend to overdo it with this kind of thing
2. Started reading through the API documentation more and realizing the spec I wrote out was too complicated/the APIs I had chosen to use had the data I wanted buried way too deep for the scope of this project
3. refine my idea to focus on a much more narrow dataset
4. re-write my summary
5. realize that maybe I'll have time to build another level of functionality on it but not to get ahead of myself
6. re-watch the Intro to API video to re-learn to how even "fetch"
7. put together api & main stations class, feel satisfied that I pinpointed the data I need
8. wonder if I should switch to the data science track because I actually kind of...*enjoy* looking at JSON objects??
9. git commit, constantly!

# Day 2

10. fumble through building out the CLI class, feeling like a wizard every time I worked out a problem with binding.pry
11. roll my eyes when my code broke over something that seemed trivial
12. finally get the whole CLI working
13. review videos on anti-patterns and refactoring, make some tweaks for clarity and DRY

# Day 3
14. go over it with my cohort lead to make sure I didn't have any glaring omissions 
15. record a video walkthrough, hoping my dog doesn't interrupt me
16. write my explanatory blog post
17. slam that "I'm Done" button just in time for Halloween :)
