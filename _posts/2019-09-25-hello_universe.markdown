**Who are you?**
I'm Stef! I'm a 32-year-old human living in Chicago. I am non-binary and I use they/them pronouns. When I'm not coding or at my full-time job as an operations associate at [Breather](http://breather.com), I'm making sounds on the drums or the bass, playing with my miniature schnauzer Norman, or relaxing at one of Chicago's fine taverns.

**How did you get into coding?**
It has been a meandering path. My dad started working with computers in the 1970s and retired in 2018 as a systems analyst for a large midwestern hospital. He always encouraged (still does!) my sister and I to keep an eye on the evolution of tech, to keep our skills sharp. We got our first family computer in 1999 - a big, boxy Gateway desktop that ran Windows 98. In the Web 1.0 days my coding experiments were limited to basic HTML; for many years my knowledge ran more towards hardware troubleshooting rather than coding. 

Web development and tech were always on the periphery of my attention; I was drawn to it but left college having focused almost entirely on the humanities. I tried majoring in computer science, but quickly felt like I didn't fit in with the guys in class who seemed to already know how to write programs. As an adult with a job and a life and hobbies, I taught myself to code here and there with whatever online resources seemed the most thorough -- shout out to Codecademy and Free Code Camp -- but something was always lacking from those experiences. I attended several meetups of a lovely group called KC Women In Tech to ease my way into networking in a supportive environment.

It wasn't until I moved to Chicago in 2017 that I got serious about focussing my energy. Here there are so many more resources to network (especially with other people in tech who share marginalized identities) and opportunities to put my newfound skills to use for the greater good. I would research code bootcamps every few months, hoping to find one I could afford that also would give me the full course of study I was seeking (as opposed to more language-focused programs, for example). Flatiron expanded to Chicago and was one of the only schools that had attainable financing options and a program schedule that allows me to keep my full-time job, and there was my answer.

**What do you love about coding?**
I love a well-oiled machine. I love to do work behind the scenes. I love being the one to spot when something tiny is throwing the whole machine off. If I did college all over again, with no restrictions on where I could go or how much it would cost, I'd study linguistics. To me, linguistics is like the math of language. You're breaking down a massive lexicon into its smallest components and observing and reporting on the myriad ways we use those components to communicate. Learning a new syntax, all the bits and pieces and what they do, and learning to use these bits and pieces to communicate with the computer -- perhaps one could consider coding to be an incredibly specialized niche of linguistics!


**How do you envision your place in the tech world?**
I want to get into this field to work in public service and to be a role model to younger people wanting to get into tech. I'm 32 and only just now meeting other people -- Black people, people of color, queer and gender nonconforming people -- working & thriving in this space. What if I'd met someone like me when I was 19 and afraid to go to my Computer Science 101 class because everyone else in the class seemed so self-assured, light-years ahead of me?

I'm looking forward to getting involved with and going to events put on by organizations such as Lesbians and Allies Who Tech, Out In Tech, Chicago Queer Tech Club, Write/Speak/Code, and Open Uptown Chicago.

Well - here we go!
